Four characteristics of Big Data:
Volume  - It refers to the large chunks of data generated daily. This enormous data has to be processed using Big Data. 
Variety - The data generated will be of different types. This hetrogenous data can include any type of data which makes it quite difficult           to process using normal methods. 
Velocity- The speed at which the data is generated. It refers to the exponential grpwth of data.
Variability- Large inconsistencies can again compromise with the accuracy and processing. Making it more dificult to handle.
Veracity- This refers to the quality aspect of data. Poor quality can largely affect accury and analysis.

Solutions:
Vertical Scaling    - To increase the capacity of a single machine. Like storage, RAM etc. Multiple machines are not involved.
Horizontal Scaling  - Involves multiple machines. The load is distributed among many machines to increase the capacity.

Ans 3
Scale-up:
    -Also called Vertical Scaling. 
    -To increase the capacity of a single machine. Like storage, RAM etc. 
    -Multiple machines are not involved.
    -It can solve capacity problem without network connectivity. 
    -However, its associated with extra space, power etc. 
    -AlthoughS the costs have not scaled up.

Scale-out: 
    -Also called Horizontal Scaling.
    -The load is distributed among many machines to increase the capacity.
    -Involves multiple machines.
    -However, storage requires additional storage (nodes) to add performance.
    -The scale-out storage continues to be represented as a single system.
